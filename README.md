## Introduction
In this project we have to do data analysis to provide the following solution:
* Identify blocks/districts/states with critical/average/increased groundwater levels in the country.
* Analyze Pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels in 2017 with respect to previous year.
* Analyze pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels in 2017 with decadal mean (2007-2016).
* Time series analysis of groundwater level from 1996 to 2018 for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon duration.
* Percentage increase and decrease in the groundwater level at various sites(bore well, dug well and tube well)
