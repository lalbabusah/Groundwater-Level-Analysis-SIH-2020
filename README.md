## Solution:
### 1.Identified blocks/districts/states with critical/average/increased groundwater levels in the country.
### 2.Analyzed Pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels in 2017 with respect to previous year i.e. 2016
### 3.Analyzed pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels in 2017 with decadal mean (2007-2016)
### 4.Time series analysis of groundwater level from 1996 to 2018 for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon duration (using ARIMA [Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average] model and BI tool - Tableau)
### 5.Percentage increase and decrease in the groundwater level at various sites(bore well, dug well and tube well)

## Data Acquisition: 
We have downloaded data from the website of CGWA- IndiaWRIS (Water Resources Information System) for data analysis.

## Data Preprocessing: 
We have used Python(Libraries-Pandas, NumPy) on Jupyter notebook platform for data preprocessing.

## Data Visualization and Analysis:
We have used Business Intelligence tool â€“TABLEAU for data visualisation and analysis after data preprocessing.

## Data Model:
Machine Learning model ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting.
