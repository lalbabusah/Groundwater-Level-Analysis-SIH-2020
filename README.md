## Introduction
In this project we have to do data analysis to provide the following solution:
* Identify blocks/districts/states with critical/average/increased groundwater levels in the country.
* Analyze Pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels in 2017 with respect to previous year.
* Analyze pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels in 2017 with decadal mean (2007-2016).
* Time series analysis of groundwater level from 1996 to 2018 for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon duration.
* Percentage increase and decrease in the groundwater level at various sites(bore well, dug well and tube well)

## Data Acquisition
Downloaded data from the website of CGWA- IndiaWRIS (Water Resources Information System) for data analysis.

## Data Preprocessing 
Used Python(Libraries-Pandas, NumPy) on Jupyter notebook platform for data analysis.

## Data Visualization and Analysis
Used Business Intelligence tool â€“TABLEAU for data visualisation and analysis. 
Here is the Tableau Public link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/lalbabusah

## Model Development
Used Machine Learning model ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting.
